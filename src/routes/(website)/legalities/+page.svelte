        <h2>Cookies and Other Information Collection Tools</h2>
        <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong> A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website or use an online service. When you visit the website or use the service again, the cookie allows that website or online service to recognize your browser or device. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information.</p>
        <p><strong>Why do we use them?</strong> Cookies help us improve the Service by providing us with information about which parts of the Service are most popular, enabling us to analyze technical and navigational information about the Service, and helping us to detect and prevent fraud. We also use cookies and other data collection tools (such as web beacons and server logs) to help improve your experience with the Service. For example, we use analytics services to help analyze how users use the Service. These tools use cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Service (including IP address) is transmitted to our data collection tool service providers. This information is then used by us to evaluate visitors' use of the Service and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Batlas. We also may use third party advertisements on the Service. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on the Service, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>
        <p><strong>How do I control cookies?</strong> Web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. To find out more about cookies, including how to manage and delete cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org. Some web browsers provide settings that allow a user to reject cookies or to alert a user when a cookie is placed on the user's computer, tablet or mobile device. Most mobile devices also offer settings to reject mobile device identifiers. Although users are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, blocking or rejecting them may prevent access to some features available through the Service.</p>
