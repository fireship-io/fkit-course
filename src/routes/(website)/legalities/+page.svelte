        <h2>Cookies and Other Information Collection Tools</h2>
        <p><strong>What are cookies?</strong> A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website or use an online service. When you visit the website or use the service again, the cookie allows that website or online service to recognize your browser or device. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information.</p>
        <p><strong>Why do we use them?</strong> Cookies help us improve the Service by providing us with information about which parts of the Service are most popular, enabling us to analyze technical and navigational information about the Service, and helping us to detect and prevent fraud. We also use cookies and other data collection tools (such as web beacons and server logs) to help improve your experience with the Service. For example, we use analytics services to help analyze how users use the Service. These tools use cookies to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form.

This information is then used by us to evaluate visitors' use of the Service and to compile statistical reports on website activity for Batlas.

Most mobile devices also offer settings to reject mobile device identifiers. Although users are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, blocking or rejecting them may prevent access to some features available through the Service.</p>
