# Classes
# Thief

The thief is a person of skill and cunning. When presented with two options the Thiefs will take the third and come out on top. Nimble, dextrous, and self-interested, Thieves often find themselves in difficult situations using whatever they have to rig a solution.

### Gear
* Weapon or ranged weapon
* Small weapon
* 2 tools

## Trickster
Trickster believe that cheating is part of every game, that rules are just hurdles, and that you're hands should remain clean because you can convince another to dirty their own.  
Often with thinning moral fabric, the Trickster is a cunning and deceptive character. They rely on charisma, manipulation, and guile to advance toward their wants.

### Disguise kit
With 5 minutes of time, the Trickster can assume the appearance of another person. This kit doesn't change the Trickster size, frame, or clothing (though it does come with a collection of accessories like glasses, badges, jewellery, etc.)

### Gadget bag
The Trickster never knows what they'll need in a given momenet so they bring the ingredients for any answer. The Trickster has a bag of various gadget pieces that they can piece together into various contraptions. Each gadget pieces can only be used once but there is no limit to how many can be combined into a single gadget.

## Acrobat
Where most see a prison, a cliff face, or certain plummeting death, the Acrobat sees a gentle stroll, tumble, and flip. Experts in contortion, momentum, and balance, Acrobats are never oppressed by gravity.

### Featherweight
It may be from a magical cloak, an enchanted ring, or a mystic skill learned from a travelling circus but one way or another the Acrobat has gained the ability to make themselves as light as a feather for a few seconds at a time (roll 2d6 to determine how many seconds each time this ability is used). Common uses for this gift are to launch oneself at moments of momentum and to negate damage from great heights but this ability is limited only by creativity.

### Momentum
Each acrobatic maneuvour done in succession grants the next movement a support dice. These support dice stack up to 3.

For example, you succeed on running across a narrow beam. So, when you try to flip off that beam onto a seasaw below, your flip will have a support die. When that flip succeeds and you launch off the seasaw below you will have 2 support dice for you attempt to use that seasaw launch to land on the back of a moving horse.

When there would be a difficult maneuvre, try to build momentum up to it.

# Magician
Magicians bend the mysterious energies of the universe to their will.  
The physical world is like clay to the magican who transfigure all they see.

### Gear
* Small weapon
* Focus
* Curio

## Scholar
Scholars have studied for many years to translate the material into formula. They exercise control through understanding and power through design.

### Crafted spells
Crafted spells are formed by combining a word from 2 or 3 columns. When a word is chosen it cannot be chosen again. Two words cannot be picked from the same column.

## Sorcerer
Sorcerers embrace the tempest of the unknown.  
They are a conduit for the unseen forces of the universe to flow through without control or limit.

### Arcane conduit
Sorcerers have little control over their magic. When crafting spells Sorcerers pick only 1 word with the others being determined by rolling a d20 and dividing the result by 2. The chosen word can be from any column.  
In addition, the Game Master will roll for an effect from the Chaos column that only they can see.
Sorcerers can use the same word(s) as many times as they like.

## Druid
Harmonious souls, Druids are characters of connectedness and feeling. They maintain a deep bond with the natural world. Nature commands the Druids respect and effort, and in return they are able to ask favours of it.

### Gear
* Weapon or raned weapon (no metal)
* 2 Small weapons (no metal)

### Animal Familiar
The Druid is never alone. With them is their familiar, their dearest friend. A Druid's familiar can be any animal. The familiar can understand the Druid's simple requests but cannot convey or understand most things that require language beyond simple yes or no answers (it cannot sign, draw, or relate concepts).

Druids share an unbreakable bond with their familiar:
* When one is hurt the other can suffer damage in their place.
* One always knows the direction of the other.

Famililiars are treated as part of the Druuid character. They act at the same time and the player controls both. Familiars have no class or speciality.

## Leafespeaker
Forest are not still and quiet. Leakspeakers listen to the whispers of trees, the gossip of vines, and the riddles of flowers. Years amongst the sun gilded canopies and beanth the decaying understory have taught these Druids to speak back.

### Influence plants
Leafspeakers can ask the plants around them for favours. Vines may lift a boulder, a flower may expand into a shield, a tree may shake loose all its fruit, roots may coil and crush a foe.
Remember that these are favours, not demands, and the plants will not always listen or understand. Asking favours of this kind will require a roll based on the magnitude of the favour.

### Magic seeds
Leafspeakers start their adventures with 1d6 worth of magic seeds. These seeds can be planted in soil to grow any plant the Leafspeaker desires in an instant. These plants will always listen to the Leafspeakers favours but will wither away in 1 minute from when they were planted.  
If anyone other than a Leakspeaker plants one of these seeds the resultsing plant will be carnivorous and attempt to devour the planter.

## Shapeshifter
To be a Shapeshifter is to understand that the boundaries humans have drawn between elemenst of nature are childish and ill-conceived. There is no difference between the human's hand and bear's claw, or between the human and eagle eye. Your understanding of these false barriers allows you to alter yourself.

## Shapeshift
Shapeshifters can transform themselves into animals. These transformations can be complete or can shift only part of the Shapeshifter's anatomy.

Multiple animals can be combined into a single shift but doing so will cause the Shapeshifter to suffer a point of damage. When a mult-shift is performed the Shapeshifter may combine up to 1d6 animals (rerolling 1's).

## Speak with animals (and anyone else)
Language is yet another boundary that the Shapeshifter has seen beyond. Shapeshifters can converse with any animal or creature with a language. The Shapeshifter doesn't know these language outside of conversation and cannot read or write them.

## Cleric
The world is moved by forces beyond our control but those forces are guided by the motivations of higher beings. These beings are sometimes called Gods or given names but the Cleric understands that any names or titles are barbariac translations of the will they worship.

Clerics study ancient scriptures and esoteric musings to gain insight into the hands that pulls the threads of fate. They understand there power does not originate from within them and that are a messenger of greater forces.

### Gear
* Weapon
* Shield
* Curio

### Miracles
The Cleric can invoke each of these miracles a single time. These miracles are not bound by narrative and sense.
* An ally avoids damage
* A roll succeeds or fails
* An untaken item from the Gear Stock is found

## Healer
We are put through hurt and suffering so that we might grow strong and compassionate. Healers feel the love that guides all beings and offers healing absolution for misteps and hurt caused to those that truly repent.

### Healing
Listen to the will of fate let the higher powers pass judgement on the suffering.  
The Healer can heal points of damage but must roll each time a point is restored. The roll needed for the first heal is 11 or greater.

On each success, the roll needed is increased by 3 to a max of 17 (⅕ chance). On each failure the Healer suffers a point of damage and the needed result is reduced by 3 to a minimum of 2.

The target of the healing regains a hit point regardless of the outcome of the roll.

### Guidance
When the Healer is involved in a group roll they grant an additional guidance d6 that isn’t counted in the maximum amount of dice for a group roll.

## Paladin
There are some among the living not worthy of redemption and each moment they live is an affront to the good and the decent. Paladins seek to cleanse the world of the wicked and let higher powers guide their fist.

### Condemn
The condemned is the next unfortunate soul on the Paladin's list.  
The Paladin can condemn a creature they can see. A support die is granted to any contest against the condemned.

If the Paladin attacks a target other than the condemned they do not get to add any class or speciality dice to that contest. This is ignored for undead targets.

Only one creature may be condemned at a time. The condemned can only be reassigned once the currently condemned is slain.

### Smite
The Paladin gains a support die in any contest against an undead or condemned creature. If a creature is both undead and condemned, the Paladin gains 2 support dice.

When a Paladin deals damage to an undead or condemned creature they deal an additional point of damage.
