<p>All issues are resolved by might in the end. Society just piles rules on top of that and hopes that everyone forgets. The barbarian does not forget. When things get difficult civilised folk turn to technology and magic. When they fail the civilised people will turn to words. And when words fail they turn to might. Barbarians just skip a few steps.</p><h3>Gear options</h3><ul><li>The barbarian may swap out any type of weapon for another and can ignore duplicate gear for all weapon types (yes, you can take 4 large weapons)</li></ul><h3>Injury fades, victory lasts</h3><p>The barbarian can suffer a point of damage to succeed on any roll or contest, or to deal an additional point of damage on an attack.</p><h3>Too mighty to die</h3><p>When a barbarian reaches 0 hit points they do not need to roll to remain conscious. They also only fail a death roll on a result of 8 or lower.</p>

<p>Knights are warriors of honour and defenders of virtue. They are unrivaled in martial training but will only draw their blades when forced expecting the best of all those around them, they try to set a heroic example.</p><h3>Gear options</h3><ul><li>The knight may take armour</li><li>The knight gets an additional shield</li></ul><h3>Trained combatant</h3><p>The knight gets a support die when they perform these special moves:</p><ul><li>Disarm: make a target drop whatever they are holding.</li><li>Riposte: On being hit, the knight can perform a counterattack at the same moment.</li><li>Sweep - If surrounded by multiple targets, the knight may attack up to 3.</li><li>Lunge - If there are multiple targets in a straight line, the knight can pierce 2 of them.</li><li>Footwork - The knight can use an attack to position themselves behind the target.</li></ul><p>These special manoeuvres may be applied outside of combat too.</p>
